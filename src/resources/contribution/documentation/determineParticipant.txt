1. Fetch Contribution Details:
The method starts by fetching the contribution details from the database, including joinContributions and related user information, using Prisma.

2. Validate Contribution:
It checks if the contribution with the specified contributionId exists. If not, it throws an error indicating that the contribution was not found.

3. Sort Users:
The joinContributions are sorted based on banicoop points and alphabetical order (if points are tied). Each user is then enriched with a participantNumber (1-indexed position) and a participantType (either 'SERVER' or 'USER').

4. Separate Users:
Users are separated into two groups: serverParticipants and userParticipants based on the totalServer and totalUser values.

5. Update Participant Information:
The participantNumber and participantType are updated for each participant based on their group (server or user).

6.Update Database:
The updated participant information is then used to update the database, specifically the joinContribution records.
In summary, this method automates the process of determining and updating participant numbers and types for a contribution. It considers banicoop points, alphabetical order, and the specified number of server and user spaces. The updated participant information is then persisted to the database using Prisma.
